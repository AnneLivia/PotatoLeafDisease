# Potato Leaf Diseases

This repository features a CNN model employing transfer learning with Xception architecture to classify potato leaves into Healthy, Early Blight, and Late Blight diseases.

The model is trained on a dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swastik2004/potato-leaf-diseases/data?select=Healthy). The data was collected from Rashid et al. Multi-Level Deep Learning Model for Potato Leaf Disease Recognition. Electronics. 2021; 10(17):2064. https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics10172064

## Dataset Details:

- Early Blight: Images of potato leaves infected with Early Blight (Alternaria solani), a fungal disease characterized by small, dark lesions with concentric rings. Early detection of this disease is crucial to prevent yield losses.
- Late Blight: Images of potato leaves infected with Late Blight (Phytophthora infestans), a devastating disease that causes dark, irregularly shaped lesions on leaves and stems. Late Blight can lead to complete crop loss if not managed promptly and effectively.
- Healthy Leaves: Images of potato leaves that exhibit no symptoms of disease. Healthy leaves serve as a reference category for training machine learning models.
